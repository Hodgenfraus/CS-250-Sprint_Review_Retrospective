# CS-250-Sprint_Review_Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

When a Scrum-agile team's Product Owner is communicating well with both the stakeholder and the development team, there isn't a great deal of need for interpretation of needs. Documenting the request of the end user, or documenting their agreement to the suggestions you make, and effectively communicating those needs to the development team is an imperative skill that every Product Owner must have. The Scrum-agile style also helps with this because, as each sprint is completed, there is time for reflecting upon the needs of the end user, and how they were or were not met.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Though, in a vaccuum, agile project management might seem ideal, it can be a great deal more stressful than a traditional waterfall type project management. I think it is important to keep an open mind when chosing how to approach each software engineering project, and focus on deciding which project management style is best for the project rather than what you personally prefer.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means many things; most improtantly, the qualities that one would ideally possess would be exceptional communication skills, willingness and ability to adapt to changes quickly and with a positive attitude, willingness to accept constructive criticism, and ability to adhere to industry standard practices in coding. Furthermore, it is ideal to be supportive of other team members, focusing on the successful completion of the project instead of only adhering to the work you have explicitely been assigned. Finally, personal accountability is imperative; showing up and putting in the work every day.
